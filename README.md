# JS Life

This is a simple JavaScript implementation of
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) where the cell
"board" is implemented by a grid of `div` elements of a fixed size and the "on-ness" or "off-ness"
of a cell is denoted via the presence of an `on` class.
